LiquidRecO documentation
========================

LiquidRecO is a reconstruction library for particle detectors based on the LiquidO_  opaque scintillator detector technology.

.. _LiquidO: <https://liquido.ijclab.in2p3.fr/overview/>

It provides functionality to create 3 dimensional "hits" from 2 dimensional planes of wavelength shifting fibers. 
And to fit particle tracks to those 3D clouds of hits.
